# City-of-Ottawa-Chatbot
This repository is for a chatbot created to answer questions from the Ottawa.ca website (Parking, roads, and travel section).
The repository has two Jupyter notebooks:
* chatbot model: model traning is done in this notebook.
* chatbot framework: model deployment and running the chatbot interface (Flask app) is done in this notebook.
* Note: in order to run the Flask app cell in the chatbot framework notebook, you will need to have the static and template folders saved where you will run the code.
* The static and template folders have HTML,CSS,and, JavaScript files to create the chatbot interface.
